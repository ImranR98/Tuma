Upload files to SFTP servers.

## Help

The data required to upload files to a specific path on an SFTP server is called a Target.

Saved Targets are listed on the Main screen. Click the + button at the bottom of the Main screen to add a Target.

Targets must define a Title, Username, Password or Private Key, and at least one Host with its Port. If a Password is provided, the Private Key won\'t be used.

An alternate Host can be added in case connection to the first one fails.

To Edit a saved Target or Upload files to it, swipe it to the left or right to access the relevant option.
